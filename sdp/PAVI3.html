    <p style="font-style:oblique;font-size:20px;">Espresso is a concentrated form of coffee served in small, strong shots and is the base for many coffee drinks. It's made from the same beans as coffee but is stronger, thicker, and higher in caffeine. However, because espresso is typically served in smaller servings than coffee, it has less caffeine per serving.</p>
    <p>THE RECIPE:<br>   
        1. Grind and weigh your coffee.<br>
        Using dark roast coffee beans and a quality grinder, grind enough beans to make one or two shots of espresso. (An average single shot of espresso will require 6 to 8 grams of coffee; a double shot, about 15 grams.) Your grounds should be powdery and fine, so use the finest setting on your grinder. If you're weighing your grounds, place your portafilter on the scale and tare; add coffee to the desired weight.<br>
        
        2. Distribute and tamp your shot<br>.
        Transfer the filled portafilter to a counter or flat surface. Gently distribute the grounds evenly with a finger, then use a tamper to tamp down the grounds to create a compact disk of espresso in the portafilter.<br>
        
        3. Pull your shot.<br>
        Purge the machine by running it briefly without a portafilter in place to clear the ground head. Then, lock the portafilter into the machine, position your demitasse glass — a 2- to 3-ounce glass meant to hold espresso — or other vessel underneath, and start your shot. The espresso should be ready after 25 to 30 seconds, but it will take practice with your specific machine and lots of taste tests to find your preference. (Some machines will regulate the length of the shot for you.) The final product shouldn’t be too light or too dark, shouldn’t taste too acidic or too bitter and should have a fine layer of caramel-colored crema on top.<br>
        
        4. Prepare milk if using and enjoy your espresso.<br>
        If you want to make a latte or other drink with milk, you’ll then need to steam your milk (we’ve included step-by-step milk steaming instructions in our latte how-to). Otherwise, your espresso is ready to enjoy as-is. Be sure to clean and dry the portafilter — and to purge and wipe down the milk frothing wand, if needed — when you’re done.<br>
