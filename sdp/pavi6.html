    <p>THE RECIPE:<br>   
        1. Grind the coffee beans. The best espresso comes from freshly ground coffee beans—preferably ground with a burr grinder, which produces more uniform particles than a blade grinder. Grind the beans directly into the portafilter for the freshest coffee possible.<br>
2. Tamp the beans. The next step is tamping. A tamper is a small, flat round weight with a handle—kind of like a stamp. You use the tamper to press the coffee grounds into an even disc. This will ensure that the portafilter can go into and come out of the machine properly and maximize the water's contact with the coffee. Don't press too hard, or the disc will become compacted. Apply light pressure and release with a slight twist.<br>
3. Prepare the cup. Fill a mug or glass about three-quarters full with hot water—roughly six ounces of hot water.<br>
4. Make a single or double shot of espresso. Gently slide the filter basket into the machine and turn the handle to lock it into place. Place an espresso cup underneath the portafilter. Depending on the design of your espresso machine, you'll need to flick a switch or press a button, and the coffee will stream out into the cup.<br>
5. Dilute the espresso. To preserve the crema (the creamy foam produced by espresso), pour the espresso into the cup of hot water and serve immediately. You can also pour the espresso into an empty mug or glass and top it off with hot water, but the crema might dissipate.
