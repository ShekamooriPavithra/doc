    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> RECIPE:<br>   
        1) Brew your favorite coffee.
I like dark roast best in Irish coffees, personally, but that’s my general preference. Freshly brewed coffee is the way to go!<br>

2) Add Irish whiskey to a mug.
I’m partial to Jameson. It’s the brand we used to make Irish coffees when I was a bartender. Bushmills is a less expensive option.<br>

3) Sweeten with some maple syrup.
Mind you, I like my coffee black in the mornings, but a little sweetener takes the edge off the whiskey. You could use regular sugar or brown sugar instead, but maple syrup tastes better and blends in more easily.<br>

4) Add a splash of coffee.
Gently stir to blend. Then fill the mug with coffee, leaving about 1/2-inch at the top for whipped cream.<br>

5) Top with whipped cream.
